            <h3>Easy potato peeling</h3>
            <p>
              You can easily peel potatoes with this food hack. 
              To do this, use a knife to cut a thin line around the middle of a potato.
              Then, put the potatoes in a pot and boil them in water as usual.
              Pour away the water when you have finished boiling the potatoes. 
              Then cool them a bit under cold running water. After all this, 
              you should be able to pull the skin right off the potato with your hands, 
              so you do not have to use a potato peeler anymore. 
            </p>

            <h3>Improvised hand mixer</h3>
            <p>
              For this food hack, you can simply attach a kitchen whisk to a power drill.
              It essentially becomes an electric hand mixer as a result of this.
              And it's possible to use it in the same way.
              It makes whipped cream and beating egg whites quick and easy,
              and it can even be used to make delicious milkshakes. 
              You don't need to spend a lot of money on a costly hand mixer anymore.

            <h3>Egg Slicers are not just for eggs</h3>
            <p>
              In this life hack, we'll show you how egg slicers can be used to slice a range of foods in addition to eggs.
              Instead of tediously cutting all your meals with a knife,
              you can utilise an egg slicer to perform all of the work for you. 
              It also makes it very simple. Mushrooms, butter, hot dogs, potatoes,
              cheese, strawberries, and even kiwi can all be cut into thin, evenly sliced pieces.

            <h3>Accurately place screws for hanging</h3>
            <p>
              When you want to hang something on the wall at home,
              you may easily determine where to put the screws with this home hack.
              Put a strip of masking tape on the back of the object you want to hang. 
              With a black marker, colour the points where screws might be used to hang the object. 
              Remove the tape and stick it on the wall where you want the screws to go,
              then drill the screws into the points marked on the tape.

            <h3>Vinegar deruster</h3>
            <p>
              Vinegar is a simple and effective approach to remove rust from your tools.
              Take a basin, put one of your rusty tools in it, then fill it with vinegar.
              After that, let it soak for a whole day. Remove it after a day,
              scrub off the remaining rust with a brush and dry it with a cloth. 
              Your tools will appear to be brand new after using this method.

            <h3>Cleaning film</h3>
            <p>
              If you're sick of cleaning up stains and filth on your fridge shelf, 
              you'll be relieved to learn that there's a home hack for that.
              Simply cover the shelves of your fridge with a roll of cling film.
              Put the shelves back inside and that's all there is to it. 
              Instead of wiping away stains on your fridge shelves, 
              then discard the cling film and replace it with a new layer.

            <h3>Clip wire holders</h3>
            <p>
              This office hack allows you to organise the wires that are lying around on your desk.
              You get some binder clips and attach them to your desk. 
              Feed the cables through the binder clip by removing one end of the binder 
              clip and reattaching it after you have fed the cable through the binder clip. 
              You won't have to worry about stray wires because these clips will keep them in place.

            <p>
              Dust may be removed from your keyboard by simply wiping it away using sticky notes in the office.
              There is no need to use a cloth with spray. Simply dab some sticky notes on your keyboard and you are good to go.

            <h3>Easy keyring fitting</h3>
            <p>
              Adding a new key to a keyring can be a difficult task,
              but it doesn't have to be because there's an easier way. 
              You take a staple remover and use the teeth of the staple remover
              to pry open the key ring by exerting pressure to the grooves between the rings on the key ring.
              You can now insert the new key into the key ring once the gap is large enough.
              Now you do not have to risk damaging your fingernails when trying to insert a key into a key ring.
